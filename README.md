# Solar-Project
## Project Task 
Time-Series Prediction of Global Solar Irradiance (GHI)

## Motivation 
An attempt at generating tools and knowledge for grid operators to better forecast the energy demands 

## Questions 
1. Incident solar energy varies from season to season. A statistical model might be able to capture trend and seasonality variations for a particular season, but can it be generalized for the entire year? 
2. Are the annual fluctuations seasonal or cyclic? If they are seasonal, do we experience any trend fluctuations over the course of time? And if they are cyclic, is it due to the source or grid inefficiency? 
3. Can regularized Deep Learning models aid in capturing annual variations?
